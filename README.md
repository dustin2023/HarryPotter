# Assignment: Creating a Magical Linked List - Preparing for Hogwarts


In this assignment, we'll delve into the magical world of Hogwarts by creating a system to prepare aspiring wizards and witches for their journey to the famed school of witchcraft and wizardry.

## Task 1: Creating the Hogwarts Preparatory List

### Storyline
Imagine yourself as a young wizard or witch, eagerly preparing to embark on a life-changing journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. To ensure you're fully equipped for your magical education, you've been provided with a comprehensive list of essential items.

### Requirements

#### Create the UML Class Diagram
- Design a `HogwartsPreparation` class that encompasses the various elements required for a wizarding education.
- Utilize classes such as `Wand`, `Spellbook`, `Robes`, and `PotionIngredients`.
- Illustrate the relationships between these elements using UML diagrams.

#### Static Inner Classes for Magical Items
- Implement the `Wand`, `Spellbook`, `Robes`, and `PotionIngredients` as static inner classes within the `HogwartsPreparation` class.
- Consider the nature of these items and why making them static within the context of magical preparation might be beneficial.

#### Reflection
Think about the significance of having these elements encapsulated within a single class, resembling a wizard's starter kit.

## Task 2: Implementation

### Setup
1. Fork the magical repository provided.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local environment.
3. Import the project into your preferred IDE.

### Details
1. Implement the `Wand`, `Spellbook`, `Robes`, and `PotionIngredients` classes as static inner classes within the `HogwartsPreparation` class.
	- Discuss why these classes are encapsulated within the main class and examine their significance in a wizard's journey to Hogwarts.

2. Add functionalities to the magical items.
	- Consider methods to describe the properties of each item (e.g., `describeWand()`, `describeSpellbook()`).
	- Implement interfaces to manage the magical properties and attributes of these items.

### Enchanting the List
Utilize the magic of Java programming to create an enchanting experience:

- Implement `Iterable` for the `HogwartsPreparation` class to manage the magical items.
- Develop a sorting spell using lambda expressions to sort the items based on their magical attributes.
- Utilize anonymous inner classes for creating magical filters that enhance the learning and preparation process for Hogwarts.
